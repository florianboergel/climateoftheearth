    "  2. buoyancy effects include temperature and salinity gradients. mixing brings solar heat down to the abyss at low latitudes, which may then rise through the thermocline, maintaining a circulation of sinking at high latitudes and rising at low latitudes, enabling a MOC to be maintained. salinity forcing is mainly of oppsite direction since salinity decreases with altitude due to decreasing evaporation and increasing freshwater input through precipitation and river runoff. in our current climate state the temperature effects are dominant.\n",
