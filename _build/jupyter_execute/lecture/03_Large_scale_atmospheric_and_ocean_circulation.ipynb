    "  - **density:** water is 1000 times denser than air, atmospheric density only temperature dependent, ocean density temperature and salinity dependent\n",
    "  - **heat capacity:** water has 4 times larger heat capacity than air\n",
    "  - **forcing:** Oceans are forced from the top, atmosphere from below. this has implications for mixing; also ocean currents are mostly forced by atmospheric winds, atmospheric winds are initiated by temperature contrast\n",
    "  - **spatiality:** atmoshpere has no boundaries while the oceans have lateral boundaries with small gateways between the 3 major basins (e.g. Indonesia through flow, Drake passage)\n",
    "  - **latent heating:** (=energy transferred in a process without change of the body's temperature, for example, in a phase change), not happening in oceans, atmospheric circulation is driven by latent heating by water phase transitions (e.g. liquid to water vapour and vice versa) to some part\n",

H. and left on the S. H. - this process is also called Ekamn transport. now water is incompressible and due to continuity if surface water gets pushed away from coast water from deeper down has to rise at the coast: upwelling. if surface water gets pushed to the coast it has to sink down due to continuity, no other place to go: downwelling.\n",

    "#### The ocean's overall role in climate\n",
    "- The world ocean plays a crucial role in our climate system. It moderates climate in time (diurnally and annually) and redistributes heat spatially in the large-scale ocean circulation. Furthermore its albedo is lower than that of sea ice and it influences the distribution of water vapor which acts as the strongest greenhouse gas.\n",
    "- Atmospheric heat transport is characterized by the Hadley Cell for low latitudes and weather systems and the Ferrell cell for mid latitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example I\n",
    "- A comparison of the annual temperature profiles of San Francisco (west coast) and New York (east coast) showcases the ocean's strong influence on local climate, see Fig. 17. Both cities are located at latitudes around 40°N where strong easterly winds dominate the atmospheric circulation. These winds expose New York to the continental climate of Central Northern America resulting in a strong seasonal temperature cycle. On the other side of the continent San Franciscos climate follows the eastward transported oceanic climate. Because of the high heat capacity of water, temperature changes are way smaller which flattens San Franciscos seasonal temperature cycle significantly.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example II\n",
    "- As previously discussed, the global conveyor belt (Fig. 10) transports warm and cold water masses along the world ocean. One way of quantifying the circulation is to look at the meridional heat transport as shown in Fig. 17 and 18. Note that northward transport is characterized with a positive sign. Whilte the atmosphere generally transports more energy, the oceanic transport is actually stronger for latitudes up to 10°S and °N. The heat is transported poleward on both Hemispheres with a maximum between 30-40°S and °N respectively. Fig. 18, right decomposes the total oceanic heat transport into the transports along the three main oceanic basins of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean. Note the different signs of the heat transport in the Southern Hemisphere.\n",
