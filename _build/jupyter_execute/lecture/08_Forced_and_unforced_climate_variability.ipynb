Going back in time the amount and quality of measurements decrases drastically (see Fig. 4). Geopolitical events such as wars influenced the data coverage (see Fig. 5).

    "- Climate proxies are a very important subject in paleo climate science. They carry information about the climate during past times where no measurements are available. However the interpretation of these proxies is really difficult. The thickness of tree rings for example is not only dependend on the summer temperature, but also on other factors that have nothing to do with temperature, such as rainfall, extreme weather events, insects, etc.. Consequently climate proxies deliver nothing more than estimates of past climate. The estimates however are still very important, so let's go through the most common proxies!\n",

Additionally ice cores carry small air bubbles that have preserved the chemical atmospheric composition of the past.\n",

    "  - Ice-albedo: Ice has a significantly higher albedo (reflectivity) the the ocean. Thus is reflects more of the incoming solar radiation than the ocean, decreasing the net incoming radiation and effectively leading to a stronger cooling.\n",
    "  - Water vapor: A colder climate causes more atmospheric water vapor to freeze reducing cloud cover. A decrease in water vapor, the strongest greenhouse gas, results in further temperature decrease.\n",
    "  - Altitude cooling: Glaciers grew up to 4.000m high. In these heights the air pressure is substantially lower which causes water to freeze at higher temperatures above 0°C (remember phase diagram of water) additionally increasing ice volume.\n",
    "  - Atmospheric circulation: Large glaciers (such as Greenland) have a distinct impact on the atmospheric circulation.\n",
