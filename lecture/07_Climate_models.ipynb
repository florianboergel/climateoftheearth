    "  1. Energy Balance Models (EBMs): Based on a radiation balance between Sun and Earth, remember lecture 2.  \n",
    "  2. Single-Column Models (SCMs): Analysing the atmosphere as a single vertical column. So the horizontal structure is neglected and the focus lies on the vertical structure.\n",
    "  3. General circulation models (GCMs): Modeling ocean or atmosphere or both (coupled GCM) in 3D on a global scale. Different GCMs implement a different amount of characteristic processes of the climate system.\n",
    "  4. Regional climate models (RCMs): Modeling the climate for a certain region, i. e. the Baltic Sea region. They can account for regional features such as coastal effects or topography and generally operate on a higher resolution than GCMs.\n",
    "  5. Earth System Models (ESMs): Even more refined than GCMs incorporating more processes, generally coupling different sub-models. Covering all components of the climate system: Atmosphere, Hydrosphere, Cryosphere, Lithosphere, Biosphere, Pedosphere.\n",

    "- Now we have chosen appropriate grid spacing and time evolution discretization. So let's go, we can run the model as follows:\n",
    "  1. Start from a given state of the climate system: Initialize each box for each state variable (temperature, pressure and many more)\n",
    "  2.  Calculate time tendencies of the state variables based on their current configuration (simply put: the temperature of this box will increase because all of the surrounding boxes are much warmer -> heat flux through the boundaries of the box)\n",
    "  3.  Add the calculated tendencies to the state of the system (these are the new temperature, pressure, etc. of this box)\n",
    "  4.  Derive new tendencies, add to the state etc.\n",
    "- So far so easy. But their are two important remaining questions to be answered:\n",
    "  - Which initial state should be chosen? The initial state has a crucial impact for the entire integration. Remember deterministic chaos.\n",
    "  - How do we actually compute the tendencies in 2.? This is where the physics happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensemble runs\n",
    "- A common method to acheive results that are least influenced by the inner variability of the system are ensemble runs. If a model is run from slightly differing initial states the outcome can be totally different due to the internal variability of the system. This variability is an important feature of the climate system, not only in models but in the real world. In order to obtain the tendencies of the model an ensemble of runs with slightly different initial conditions are performed and averaged. \n",

They are derived from conservation principles for mass, salinty and momentum and the first and second law of thermodynamics.\n",
    "- For example a box has a given temperature. Now the temperature tendency for the box $\\Delta T$ (along with the tendencies of all other state variables for all boxes) is computed by solving the discretized primitive equations for a given time step. Adding the temperature tendency onto the previous temperature of the box yields the new temperature after the time step. This is done again and again until the time is propagated as wanted.\n",

    "## General problems of climate models\n",
    "#### 1. Useful models must be simpler than the real atmosphere/ocean.  \n",
    "- Time propagation is based on the primitive equations. These are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations using approximations which are carried into the model. That way the problem is simplified while retaining key physical phenomena:\n",
    "  - Hydrostatic approximation:  \n",
    "    Eliminates vertical acceleration terms by assuming $\\frac{dp}{dz}=-\\rho g$\n",
    "  - Traditional approximation:  \n",
    "    Neglecting coriolis terms in the horizontal momentum equations involving the vertical velocity and smaller metric terms.\n",
    "  - Shallow-water approximation:  \n",
    "    Assuming that the depth of the ocean is small compared to the scale of characteristic processes.\n",
    "  - Boussinesq approximation for the ocean:  \n",
    "    Eliminates sound waves while still accounting for buoyancy. It assumes that the ocean density is constant except in the buoyancy term, where small density differences play a significant role.\n",
    "- Another commonly applied method is the Reynolds averaging of the primitive equations:\n",
    "  - Reynolds averaging:  \n",
    "    Separating the flow variables (i.e. $u,p,\\rho$) into mean values (i.e. $\\bar{u},\\bar{p},\\bar{\\rho}$ representing the large-scale flow and fluctuating values (i.e. $u',p',\\rho'$) representing the turbulence, and then time-averaging on a time scale large enough to filter out the turbulence but small enough to preserve the large-scale flow field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Discrete equations are not the same as continous equations (calculation error).  \n",
    "- The only way to solve the primitive equations (set of non-linear differential equations) is to discretize them and solve them numerically. The discretization happens on temporal and spatial scale: vertical columns of latitude-longitude boxes for which all variable values get updated each time step $\\Delta t$. The discretizations are derived from the Taylor-series expansions. Let's look at the pressure as a fuction of time $p(t)$ as an example. Taylor expansion around $p(t)$. A forward time step is given as:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: efwd\n",
    "p(t+\\Delta t) &= p(t) + \\Delta t \\frac{\\partial p(t)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta t^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 p(t)}{\\partial t^2} + ...\\\\\n",
    "```\n",
    "- and a backward time can be described by:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: ebwd\n",
    "p(t-\\Delta t) &= p(t) - \\Delta t \\frac{\\partial p(t)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta t^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 p(t)}{\\partial t^2} - ...\\\\\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The two expansions [](#efwd) and [](#ebwd) can be processed differently to different gain schemes approximating $\\frac{\\partial p(t)}{\\partial t}$. Rewriting the expansion [](#efwd) up to the first-order term $+\\Delta t \\frac{\\partial p(t)}{\\partial t}$ yields:\n",
    "```{math}\n",

    "- Substracting the two expansions results in:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\frac{p(t+\\Delta t) - p(t-\\Delta t)}{2\\Delta t}+\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)~~(\\mathrm{central~difference~scheme})\n",
    "```\n",
    "- There are other methods to describe the first derivative with higher-order accuracy.\n",
    "- Derivatives with repsect to other variables are discretized in the same way. For higher-order derivatives schemes with different accuracies (leading order error term) can be deployed. The simplest example can be be deduced adding our two Taylor-expansions [](#efwd) and [](#ebwd). The result is called the three-point-stencil, because the value of the second derivative is given by the values of three points:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial^2 p(t)}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{p(t+\\Delta t)-2p(t) + p(t-\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t^2}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are many more funky tools to navigate the numerical solution of differential equations. The lecture [Computational Quantum and Many-Particle Physics](https://pruefung.uni-rostock.de/qisserver/rds?state=verpublish&publishContainer=modulDetail&_form=publish&modulversion.versionsid=7225&menuid=&topitem=locallinks&subitem=) facilitates a deeper dive into the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inevitably the discretization introduces several errors to the numerical output of the model:\n",
    "  - Truncation error: The Taylor-expansions which build the foundation of the schemes have to be truncated at some point. Above we did it after the first-order and neglected all higher-order terms. This truncation inevitable leads to an error in the model computations.\n",
    "  - Stability: Some numerical methods can cause instability when solving certain types of differential equations. This instability can cause solutions to diverge or to behave erraticly which leads to inaccurate results.\n",
    "  - Numerical diffusion: Espacially for systems with sharp gradients some numerical methods can cause artificial diffusion, affecting the dynamics of the system and thus leading to inaccuracies.\n",
    "  - Numerical dispersion: Solving wave propagation problems, discretization can introduce additional errors related to the dispersion characteristics of the numerical method. This can lead to deformations of the waveforms.\n",

    "- The sources of uncertainty in model computations vary with time. Only for the first one or two decades of lead time the internal variability has a significant impact on the result. Model uncertainty (the difference between models) is largest at high latitudes and the emission scenario uncertainty grows with lead time particularly in lower latitudes. Hawkins and Sutton (2009) found that even at the end of the century the model uncertainty dominates at higher latitudes, while the emission scenario attributes for most of the explained variance at lower latitudes.\n",
